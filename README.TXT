HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:Run "java Driver" in the terminal
AUTHORS: Edward Lynch-Milner
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

On a Windows PC, double click the Run.bat file but make sure you run it inside the directory
containing the java files or else errors will occur

---FOR THE TECH EXPERTS---
1.P.S. The Driver.java file included in this project is solely for the purpose of testing
every method provided by our Spreadsheet class as often as possible to provide an increased
level of confidence in that the methods work correctly. You can add any commands as to your wishes
in the Driver.java file to test the methods. 

2.Open the command prompt, on Windows press CTRL + R and type cmd. (Shortcut below)

3.Type cd <Drive Letter>:\Dir1\Dir2 etc.

For example, say the files were located in a folder called assignment inside a directory
called Programming Assignment on a flash drive of drive G:, you would type:

	cd G:\Programming Assignment\assignment\

4.Type "javac Driver.java" without quotes, to ensure you have the latest class file possible.
Note that you will not need to compile the Spreadsheet.java file separately if it is referenced
in the Driver.java file already

5.Finally enter "java Driver" and the program should execute

-----SHORTCUT----
